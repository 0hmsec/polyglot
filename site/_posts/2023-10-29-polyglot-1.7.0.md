title: Polyglot 1.7.0 and `lang_id` front-matter for different permalinks by language
lang: en

I'm excited to announce Jekyll-Polyglot 1.7.0, which has a new feature to give pages language specific permalinks and retain their association to other relative pages.

This new feature is provided by **[antoniovazquezblanco](https://github.com/antoniovazquezblanco)**, who is a gentleman and a scholar.

## use `lang_id` frontmatter to associate pages with different permalinks

Polyglot associates pages by matching their permalinks or filenames. However some site translations may instead desire pages with unique permalinks.
